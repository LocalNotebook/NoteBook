A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device\\ncapable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the\\nnetwork.\\n“Computer network’’ to mean a collection of autonomous computers\\ninterconnected by a single technology. Two computers are said to be\\ninterconnected if they are able to exchange information.\\nThe connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves,\\ninfrared, and communication satellites can also be used.\\nNetworks come in many sizes, shapes and forms, as we will see later.\\nThey are usually connected together to make larger networks, with the\\nInternet being the most well-known example of a network of networks.\\nThere is considerable confusion in the literature between a computer\\nnetwork and a distributed system. The key distinction is that in a distributed\\nsystem, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single\\ncoherent system. Usually, it has a single model or paradigm that it presents to\\nthe users. Often a layer of software on top of the operating system, called\\nmiddleware, is responsible for implementing this model. A well-known\\nexample of a distributed system is the World Wide Web. It runs on top of the\\nInternet and presents a model in which everything looks like a document (Web\\npage).\\nUSES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS\\n1.

As long as the subjects are restricted to technical topics or hobbies\\nlike gardening, not too many problems will arise.\\nThe trouble comes with topics that people actually care about, like politics,\\nreligion, or sex. Views that are publicly posted may be deeply offensive to some\\npeople. Worse yet, they may not be politically correct. Furthermore, opinions\\nneed not be limited to text; high-resolution color photographs and video clips\\nare easily shared over computer networks. Some people take a live-and-let-live\\nview, but others feel that posting certain material (e.g., verbal attacks on\\nparticular countries or religions, pornography, etc.) is simply unacceptable and\\nthat such content must be censored. Different countries have different and\\nconflicting laws in this area. Thus, the debate rages.\\nComputer networks make it very easy to communicate. They also make it\\neasy for the people who run the network to snoop on the traffic. This sets up\\nconflicts over issues such as employee rights versus employer rights.\\nMany people read and write email at work. Many employers have claimed the\\nright to read and possibly censor employee messages, including messages sent\\nfrom a home computer outside working hours. Not all employees agree with\\nthis, especially the latter part.\\nAnother conflict is centered around government versus citizen’s rights.\\nA new twist with mobile devices is location privacy. As part of the process of\\nproviding service to your mobile device the network operators learn where you\\nare at different times of day. This allows them to track your movements. They\\nmay know which nightclub you frequent and which medical center you visit.\\nPhishing ATTACK: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used\\nto steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs\\nwhen an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into\\nopening an email, instant message, or text message.', metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content='BOTNET ATTACK: Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service\\nattack (DDoS attack), steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access\\nthe device and its connection.\\nThe effectiveness of a data communications system depends on four\\nfundamental characteristics: delivery, accuracy, timeliness, and jitter.\\nI. Delivery. The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Data must\\nbe received by the intended device or user and only by that device or user.\\n2 Accuracy. The system must deliver the data accurately. Data that have been\\naltered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable.\\n3. Timeliness. The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data\\ndelivered late are useless. In the case of video and audio, timely delivery means\\ndelivering data as they are produced, in the same order that they are produced,\\nand without significant delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time\\ntransmission.\\n4. Jitter. Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. It is the uneven\\ndelay in the delivery of audio or video packets. For example, let us assume that\\nvideo packets are sent every 30 ms. If some of the packets arrive with 30-ms\\ndelay and others with 40-ms delay, an uneven quality in the video is the result.\\nA data communications system has five components\\nI. Message. The message is the information (data) to be communicated.\\nPopular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.\\n2 Sender. The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a\\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.\\n3. Receiver. The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a\\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on.\\n4. Transmission medium. The transmission medium is the physical path by\\nwhich a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of\\ntransmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable,\\nand radio waves.\\n5. Protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It\\nrepresents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a\\nprotocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a\\nperson speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only\\nJapanese.\\nData Representation', metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content='Text\\nNumbers\\nImages\\nAudio\\nVideo\\nData Flow\\nCommunication between two devices can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex\\nas shown in Figure.\\nSimplex In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-\\nway street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit; the other can\\nonly receive (Figure a). Keyboards and traditional monitors are examples of\\nsimplex devices.\\nHalf-Duplex\\nIn half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the\\nsame time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice\\nversa (Figure b).

The performance of a network depends on a number\\nof factors, including the number of users, the type of transmission medium, the\\ncapabilities of the connected hardware, and the efficiency of the software.\\nPerformance is often evaluated by two networking metrics: throughput and\\ndelay. We often need more throughput and less delay. However, these two\\ncriteria are often contradictory. If we try to send more data to the network, we\\nmay increase throughput but we increase the delay because of traffic\\ncongestion in the network.\\nReliability: In addition to accuracy of delivery, network reliability is measured\\nby the frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from a failure, and\\nthe network's robustness in a catastrophe.\\nSecurity: Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized\\naccess, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing\\npolicies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data losses.\\nPhysical Structures\\nBefore discussing networks, we need to define some network attributes.\\nType of Connection\\nA network is two or more devices connected through links. A link is a\\ncommunications pathway that transfers data from one device to another.\\nThere are two possible types of connections: point-to-point and multipoint.\\nPoint-to-Point A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between\\ntwo devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission\\nbetween those two devices.

The idea was that each host computer (not necessarily from the\\nsame manufacturer) would be attached to a specialized computer, called an\\ninteiface message processor (IMP). The IMPs, in tum, would be connected to\\none another. Each IMP had to be able to communicate with other IMPs as well\\nas with its own attached host. By 1969, ARPANET was a reality. Four nodes, at\\nthe University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California\\nat Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and the University\\nof Utah, were connected via the IMPs to form a network. Software called the\\nNetwork Control Protocol (NCP) provided communication between the hosts.\\nIn 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core\\nARPANET group, collaborated on what they called the Internetting Projec1.\\nCerf and Kahn's landmark 1973 paper outlined the protocols to achieve end-\\nto-end delivery of packets.

What the physical layer does is\\naccept a raw bit stream and attempt to deliver it to the destination. This bit\\nstream is not guaranteed to be error free. The number of bits received may be\\nless than, equal to, or more than the number of bits transmitted, and they\\nmay have different values. It is up to the data link layer to detect and, if\\nnecessary, correct errors. The usual approach is for the data link layer to\\nbreak the bit stream up into discrete frames and compute the checksum for\\neach frame (framing). When a frame arrives at the destination, the\\nchecksum is recomputed. If the newly computed checksum is different from\\nthe one contained in the frame, the data link layer knows that an error has\\noccurred and takes steps to deal with it (e.g., discarding the bad frame and\\npossibly also sending back an error report).We will look at four framing\\nmethods:\\n1. Character count.\\n2. Flag bytes with byte stuffing.\\n3. Starting and ending flags, with bit stuffing.\\n4. Physical layer coding violations.\\nCharacter count method uses a field in the header to specify the number of\\ncharacters in the frame. When the data link layer at the destination sees the\\ncharacter count, it knows how many characters follow and hence where the end\\nof the frame is. This technique is shown in Fig. (a) For four frames of sizes 5, 5,\\n8, and 8 characters, respectively.', metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 36, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content=\"A character stream.

If, according to its table, node B\\nthinks that the optimum route to reach X is via A, it does not need to advertise this piece of\\ninformation to A; the information has come from A (A already knows). Taking information\\nfrom node A, modifying it, and sending it back to node A creates the confusion. In our\\nscenario, node B eliminates the last line of its routing table before it sends it to A. In this\\ncase, node A keeps the value of infinity as the distance to X. Later when node A sends its\\nrouting table to B, node B also corrects its routing table. The system becomes stable after\\nthe first update: both node A and B know that X is not reachable.\\n3. Split Horizon and Poison Reverse Using the split horizon strategy has one drawback.\\nNormally, the distance vector protocol uses a timer, and if there is no news about a route,\\nthe node deletes the route from its table. When node B in the previous scenario eliminates\\nthe route to X from its advertisement to A, node A cannot guess that this is due to the split\\nhorizon strategy (the source of information was A) or because B has not received any news\\nabout X recently. The split horizon strategy can be combined with the poison reverse\\nstrategy. Node B can still advertise the value for X, but if the source of information is A, it\\ncan replace the distance with infinity as a warning: \"Do not use this value; what I know\\nabout this route comes from you.\"\\nThe Count-to-Infinity Problem', metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 89, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content='Link State Routing\\nLink state routing is based on the assumption that, although the global knowledge about the\\ntopology is not clear, each node has partial knowledge: it knows the state (type, condition, and\\ncost) of its links.

Delivery. The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Data must\\nbe received by the intended device or user and only by that device or user.\\n2 Accuracy. The system must deliver the data accurately. Data that have been\\naltered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable.\\n3. Timeliness. The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data\\ndelivered late are useless. In the case of video and audio, timely delivery means\\ndelivering data as they are produced, in the same order that they are produced,\\nand without significant delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time\\ntransmission.\\n4. Jitter. Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. It is the uneven\\ndelay in the delivery of audio or video packets. For example, let us assume that\\nvideo packets are sent every 30 ms. If some of the packets arrive with 30-ms\\ndelay and others with 40-ms delay, an uneven quality in the video is the result.\\nA data communications system has five components\\nI. Message. The message is the information (data) to be communicated.\\nPopular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.\\n2 Sender. The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a\\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.\\n3. Receiver. The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a\\ncomputer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on.\\n4. Transmission medium. The transmission medium is the physical path by\\nwhich a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of\\ntransmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable,\\nand radio waves.\\n5. Protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It\\nrepresents an agreement between the communicating devices.

The idea was that each host computer (not necessarily from the\\nsame manufacturer) would be attached to a specialized computer, called an\\ninteiface message processor (IMP). The IMPs, in tum, would be connected to\\none another. Each IMP had to be able to communicate with other IMPs as well\\nas with its own attached host. By 1969, ARPANET was a reality. Four nodes, at\\nthe University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California\\nat Santa Barbara (UCSB), Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and the University\\nof Utah, were connected via the IMPs to form a network. Software called the\\nNetwork Control Protocol (NCP) provided communication between the hosts.\\nIn 1972, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, both of whom were part of the core\\nARPANET group, collaborated on what they called the Internetting Projec1.\\nCerf and Kahn's landmark 1973 paper outlined the protocols to achieve end-\\nto-end delivery of packets.

In a Half-Duplex mode, only one node\\ncan transmit the data at the same time.\\nFRAMING:\\nTo provide service to the network layer, the data link layer must use the\\nservice provided to it by the physical layer. What the physical layer does is\\naccept a raw bit stream and attempt to deliver it to the destination. This bit\\nstream is not guaranteed to be error free. The number of bits received may be\\nless than, equal to, or more than the number of bits transmitted, and they\\nmay have different values. It is up to the data link layer to detect and, if\\nnecessary, correct errors. The usual approach is for the data link layer to\\nbreak the bit stream up into discrete frames and compute the checksum for\\neach frame (framing). When a frame arrives at the destination, the\\nchecksum is recomputed. If the newly computed checksum is different from\\nthe one contained in the frame, the data link layer knows that an error has\\noccurred and takes steps to deal with it (e.g., discarding the bad frame and\\npossibly also sending back an error report).We will look at four framing\\nmethods:\\n1. Character count.\\n2. Flag bytes with byte stuffing.\\n3. Starting and ending flags, with bit stuffing.\\n4. Physical layer coding violations.\\nCharacter count method uses a field in the header to specify the number of\\ncharacters in the frame. When the data link layer at the destination sees the\\ncharacter count, it knows how many characters follow and hence where the end\\nof the frame is. This technique is shown in Fig. (a) For four frames of sizes 5, 5,\\n8, and 8 characters, respectively.', metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 36, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content=\"A character stream.

For example, if the character count of 5 in the second\\nframe of Fig. (b) becomes a 7, the destination will get out of synchronization\\nand will be unable to locate the start of the next frame. Even if the checksum\\nis incorrect so the destination knows that the frame is bad, it still has no way\\nof telling where the next frame starts. Sending a frame back to the source\\nasking for a retransmission does not help either, since the destination does\\nnot know how many characters to skip over to get to the start of the\\nretransmission. For this reason, the character count method is rarely used\\nanymore.\\nFlag bytes with byte stuffing method gets around the problem of\\nresynchronization after an error by having each frame start and end with\\nspecial bytes. In the past, the starting and ending bytes were different, but in\\nrecent years most protocols have used the same byte, called a flag byte, as\\nboth the starting and ending delimiter, as shown in Fig. (a) as FLAG. In this\\nway, if the receiver ever loses synchronization, it can just search for the flag\\nbyte to find the end of the current frame.

One way to solve this\\nproblem is to have the sender's data link layer insert a special escape byte\\n(ESC) just before each ''accidental'' flag byte in the data. The data link layer\\non the receiving end removes the escape byte before the data are given to\\nthe network layer. This technique is called byte stuffing or character stuffing.\", metadata={'source': 'cn.pdf', 'file_path': 'cn.pdf', 'page': 37, 'total_pages': 306, 'ModDate': 'D:20190610101718Z', 'Producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com'}), Document(page_content=\"Thus, a framing flag byte can be distinguished from one in the data by the\\nabsence or presence of an escape byte before it.\\nWhat happens if an escape byte occurs in the middle of the data? The\\nanswer is that, it too is stuffed with an escape byte. Thus, any single escape\\nbyte is part of an escape sequence, whereas a doubled one indicates that a\\nsingle escape occurred naturally in the data. Some examples are shown in\\nFig. (b). In all cases, the byte sequence delivered after de stuffing is exactly\\nthe same as the original byte sequence.\\nA major disadvantage of using this framing method is that it is closely\\ntied to the use of 8-bit characters. Not all character codes use 8-bit\\ncharacters. For example UNICODE uses 16-bit characters, so a new technique\\nhad to be developed to allow arbitrary sized characters\\nStarting and ending flags, with bit stuffing allows data frames to\\ncontain an arbitrary number of bits and allows character codes with an arbitrary\\nnumber of bits per character. It works like this. Each frame begins and ends\\nwith a special bit pattern, 01111110 (in fact, a flag byte). Whenever the\\nsender's data link layer encounters five consecutive 1s in the data, it\\nautomatically stuffs a 0 bit into the outgoing bit stream. This bit stuffing is\\nanalogous to byte stuffing, in which an escape byte is stuffed into the outgoing\\ncharacter stream before a flag byte in the data.\\nWhen the receiver sees five consecutive incoming 1 bits, followed by a 0 bit,\\nit automatically de- stuffs (i.e., deletes) the 0 bit. Just as byte stuffing is\\ncompletely transparent to the network layer in both computers, so is bit\\nstuffing. If the user data contain the flag pattern, 01111110, this flag is\\ntransmitted as 011111010 but stored in the receiver's memory as 01111110.\\nFig:Bit stuffing. (a) The original data.
